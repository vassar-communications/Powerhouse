 Book by Kyle Jarrow<br/>
 Lyrics by Kyle Jarrow and Duncan Sheik<br/>
 Directed by Rachel Chavkin</p>
<p>A heartbroken man never leaves his apartment, consoled only by the music on the radio. Through the thin walls, he hears almost every word of the couple next door&#8212;and before long, his eavesdropping becomes an obsession. Soon he finds himself drawn into a web of lust, lies, deceit and danger. Tony and Grammy Award-winning composer Duncan Sheik (<em>Spring Awakening, American Psycho</em>) collaborates with Kyle Jarrow (<em>Whisper House, A Very Merry Unauthorized Children&#8217;s Scientology Pageant</em>) and Rachel Chavkin (<em>Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812</em>) on this lush and mysterious new musical inspired by radio plays and classic film noir.</p>
