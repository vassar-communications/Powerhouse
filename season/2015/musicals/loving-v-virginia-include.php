<p>A soulful, period musical set in the early days of the civil rights movement. In 1958, Mildred and Richard Loving, a black woman and white man, married in Central Point, Virginia, violating their state&#8217;s laws against miscegenation. Their Romeo and Juliet love story ignited a firestorm in their communities, and sparked a landmark Supreme Court case. Their love &#8211; and their fight &#8211; paved the way for future generations to seek equality. From the award-winning team of Marcus Gardley (<em>The House That Will Not Stand, Every Tongue Confess</em>), Justin Ellington (<em>The Seven, Stagger Lee</em>), and Patricia McGregor (<em>Hurt Village</em>).</p>
