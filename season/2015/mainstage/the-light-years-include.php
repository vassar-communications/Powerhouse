<p>The award-winning play-making company The Debate Society (<em>Jacuzzi, Blood Play, Buddy Cop 2</em>) crafts a haunted love story spanning 40 years. Set at the Chicago World&#8217;s Fairs of 1893 and 1933, <em>The Light Years</em> revolves around Steele MacKaye, a forgotten theatrical impresario commissioned to design and build the Spectatorium, a 12,000 seat theater at the 1893 fair. His audacious vision &#8211; and its life-changing consequences &#8211; paint a spectacularly vivid world of forgotten futures and the indomitable spirit of invention.</p>
