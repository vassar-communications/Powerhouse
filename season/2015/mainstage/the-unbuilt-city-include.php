                <p>By Keith Bunin<br/>
 Directed by Sean Mathias</p>
<p>On a cold afternoon in February, Jonah knocks on the door of a townhouse in Brooklyn Heights. He&#8217;s come to persuade Claudia to sell her famously secret art collection to a university archive. Instead she turns the tables and reveals to him a series of mysteries about the nature of love, legacy and the untold history of the city. Keith Bunin (<em>The Busy World is Hushed, The Credeaux Canvas, Sam Bendrix</em>&#8230;) returns to Powerhouse with this world premiere directed by Tony Award nominee Sean Mathias (<em>Indiscretions, Waiting for Godot/No Man&#8217;s Land</em>).</p>
