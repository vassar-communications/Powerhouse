<p>The semifinals of the U.S. Open are underway. Sergei Sergeyev, an up-and-coming Russian phenom, and Tim Porter, a great American superstar in the twilight of his career, do battle under the lights on center court. As the intense, back-and-forth action unfolds, Anna Ziegler (<em>Photograph 51, BFF</em>) and Gaye Taylor Upchurch (<em>Bethany, Simon Stephens&#8217; Bluebird</em>) take us inside the minds of these two extraordinary players to contemplate athleticism, masculinity and marriage. And by match point, much more has been won and lost than a game of tennis.</p>
