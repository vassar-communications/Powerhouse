                <p><strong>Six new plays based on stories by Tennessee Wiliams</strong></p>
<p>by Elizabeth Egloff, Marcus Gardley, Rebecca Gilman, David Grimm, John Guare, and Beth Henley<br/>
 Directed by Michael Wilson</p>
<p>Six of our best contemporary playwrights collaborate in a unique evening of short plays, inspired by a master American storyteller. Many of Williams&#8217;s stories were early sketches for his celebrated plays, and capture the same roiling emotions of people at life&#8217;s turning points, clinging to love to salve their lost innocence or their shadowy loneliness. Directed by Michael Wilson (<em>Mother of Invention at Powerhouse, The Orphans Home Cycle, Broadway&#8217;s The Trip to Bountiful</em>).</p>
