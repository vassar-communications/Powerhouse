				<p>Six new plays based on stories by Tennessee Wiliams</p>
				<p>by Elizabeth Egloff, Marcus Gardley, Rebecca Gilman, David Grimm, John Guare, and Beth Henley Directed by Michael Wilson</p>
				<p>Six of our best contemporary playwrights collaborate in a unique evening of short plays, inspired by a master American storyteller. Many of Williams’s stories were early sketches for his celebrated plays, and capture the same roiling emotions of people at life’s turning points, clinging to love to salve their lost innocence or their shadowy loneliness. Directed by Michael Wilson (Mother of Invention at Powerhouse, The Orphans Home Cycle, Broadway’s The Trip to Bountiful).</p>
